         <!-- The plot -->
        <p>
            Breaking Bad tells the story of Walter White, a struggling high school chemistry 
            teacher diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. He turns to a life of crime, producing 
            and selling methamphetamine with his former student Jesse Pinkman, with the goal of 
            securing his family's financial future before he dies. The series tracks the moral 
            decline of Walter as he transforms from a mild-mannered family man into a ruthless 
            drug lord.
